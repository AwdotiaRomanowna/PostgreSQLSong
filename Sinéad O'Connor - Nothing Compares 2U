It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took my grants away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took my grants away

Since it have been gone I can do whatever I want
I can tune whatever I choose
I can write my SQL with a fancy clause
But anywise
I said anywise can run vacuum
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to vacuum

It's became so bloated without it here
Like a DELETE without WHERE
Nothing can stop these long transactions from delays
Tell me admin do you wanna bloat?

I could count on autovacuum demon
But it’s wrongly tuned
I went to the PM and guess what he told me?
Guess what he told me?
He said girl we had an external audit
and cannot grant it to you, but try to do
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to vacuum

All the tables that were cleaned before
manually
All have bloated huge
I know that running it manually wasn’t good
But I'm willing to automate it
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to vacuum
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to vacuum
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to vacuum
