When I look into your stats
I can see the plans are bad
But darlin' when you checked it
you should to use EXPLAIN
Nothin' lasts forever
except the query you have made
And it's hard to say it'll finish
so u should to run EXPLAIN
That query runs such a long long time
Just try to kill process, oo yeah
But load is always coming and load is always going
And no one's really sure how big it go today
[Walking away]
/*
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own
Do you need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time
On their own
Don't youâ€¦*/
